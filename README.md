Milinski_et_al_2023

This repository contains data and code to support the findings presented in Milinski et al., 2023 titled 'Cortical evoked activity is modulated by the sleep state in a ferret model of tinnitus.'
Figures depicting raw or average data of EEG evoked potentials or spectral activity were based on raw data, which, due to their large size, were not included in this repository but will be made available upon request.

The code was created using MATLAB R2020b.
